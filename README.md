# Back up to Google Cloud Storage

# Laundy list
* [ ] implement the use of argument `operation`.
* [ ] modify the script, so that the local changes (e.g. moved or renamed directories) would be mirrored on the cloud. This effectively requires removing remote files that are no longer available locally.
* [ ] schedule recurring backup.
